# Solidity Test: Wrapped Ether

For practice writing tests for a simple Wrapped Ether contract using [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry).

## Code

The contract code is located in `/src/WrappedEther.sol`, and the test code is in `/test/WrappedEther.t.sol`.

## Running the Tests

1. Make sure you have Foundry set up. If not, you can refer to the [installation guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

2. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   forge install
   ```
3. Run the following command to run the tests:
   ```bash
   forge test
   ```
